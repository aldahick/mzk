# mzk

Start [mzk-api](./api/README.md) and [mzk-runner](./runner/README.md), then view [mzk-web](./web/README.md). You can upload an audio file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is then transcribed locally.

See [Automatic Music Transcription at scale](./amt-at-scale.pdf) for a detailed description of the project's goals and implementation.
